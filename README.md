# Bitfocus Event Companion

Hi everyone! I just wanted to let you guys know that things are starting to move forward with this. An app to control EventMaster (aaand qlab, pbp, imagepro, hdx, udx(pulse), ross carbonite, etc.).

Everything is still _highly experimental_, but we need beta testers!

Alpha releases (for mac): https://github.com/bitfocus/companion/releases (please read the release notes for the current version and a couple of versions back before doing anything)

Feature requests, hardware support requests, and everything are wholeheartedly welcome in https://github.com/bitfocus/companion/issues

Please don't spam this group with questions, rather join us in our Slack chat for questions if you like: https://bit.ly/2s1kw8d

Cheers!
